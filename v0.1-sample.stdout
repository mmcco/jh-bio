RepeatGenome.Kmers comprises 0.11 GB

35.25 million reads processed per minute
27.80% of the genome consists of repeat sequences
48.44% of reads were classified with a repeat sequence (726,568 of 1,500,000)
2.31% of classified reads were classified at the class tree root (34,677 reads)
on average, a classification restricted a read's possible location to 1.15% of the genome
on average, a non-root classification restricted a read's possible location to 1.11% of the genome
on average, a classification restricted a read's possible location to 1.66% of the genome (non-strict)
on average, a non-root classification restricted a read's possible location to 1.45% of the genome (non-strict)
